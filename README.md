**About the game**

So, the main purpose of creating this game on Java, was to get better at it as well as show some Java skills. Despite the fact that there are a tons of great Java developers out there, I think I did a good job here. At least that's my personal opinion. I also built this game on JavaScript time ago, which you can see on my repositories, although that game has maaaany bad practices. By that time, I didn't know good practices as I do now. I must say, I read a book on "Clean Code" a few months ago.


**What I could have done but I didn't**

I could have added a section so people can input words to the board game and hide them. Reason why I didn't is, it is too easy to do. And my main purpose of doing this game/project was to show off some "skills" on Java. So I added default words to hide, along with a shuffle button, so if you click it, the words re-shuffle over and over again. No matter how many times or fast you click the button, the operation time will not increase, nor the runtime memory usage.



**Memory and Runtime**

I checked out the runtime memory usage and garbage collection, and everything works fine. 
The runtime operation time of most of the components in the project is O(n) and O(1). Although there are
1 or 2 components in the whole project that run O(n^2), where "n" value is the hidden words length characters. 
So if there are 10 words hidden, n will be 10*10.


**Coding methology/enviroment**

I managed an Agile eviroment, I did my best on writting good and clean code. High-cohesion and Low-coupling. I believe anyone can understand this code. Although I didn't gave my 100% effort on this project, but I did my 90%. What I mean by that is that it was just something I thought of building all of the sudden, and I just started it.


**The "Hardest" of building this project**

1. Java syntax was a bit of a problem, the project took me 4 days to complete because of this, if syntax weren't a problem, I could have finish it on a few hours.

2. The naming. The naming of classes, methods and variables was a little bit of a challenge on a few sections of the project. Mainly, the mthods naming. Since I looked to code Highly-Cohesive and Low-Coupling, it became harder and harder every time I was going to "split" classes or methods in small chunks of code. But anyways, I think I did a good work.


**Bottom Line**

I'm sure there will definitely be one, two or a few things on the codes that Java developers might consider that there are better ways to do something. Again, I've never created something with Java apart from basic tests. The Java syntax and native classes are too many, something that other languages don't have. Anyways, I definitely liked working with Java, at least on the software part. I haven't used it for web and mobile (yet).

If I have any reason to build something else later on with Java I will definitely do it. At the end of the day, Java is still just one more programming language out there, with the difference that it has been for too long.
